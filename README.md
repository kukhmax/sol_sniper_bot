### FAQS

**What format should my private key be in?** 

The private key should be in the base58 string format, not bytes. 

**Why are my transactions being dropped?** 

You get what you pay for. Don't use the main-net RPC, just spend the money for Helius or Quick Node.

**How do I change the fee?** 

Modify the UNIT_BUDGET and UNIT_PRICE in the config.py. 

**Why is this failing for USDC pairs?** 

This code only works for SOL pairs. 

**Why are there "no pool keys found"?** 

IF YOU ARE USING A FREE TIER RPC, THIS REPO WILL NOT WORK FOR YOU. FREE TIER RPCS DO NOT ALLOW GET_ACCOUNT_INFO_PARSED().

### Examples

```
from raydium import buy
from utils import get_pair_address

# Buy Example
token_address = "7GCihgDB8fe6KNjn2MYtkzZcRjQy3t9GHdC8uHYmW2hr" # POPCAT
pair_address = get_pair_address(token_address)
sol_in = .1
slippage = 5
buy(pair_address, sol_in, slippage)
```

```
from raydium import sell
from utils import get_pair_address

# Sell Example
token_address = "7GCihgDB8fe6KNjn2MYtkzZcRjQy3t9GHdC8uHYmW2hr" # POPCAT
pair_address = get_pair_address(token_address)
percentage = 100
slippage = 5
sell(pair_address, percentage, slippage)
```
